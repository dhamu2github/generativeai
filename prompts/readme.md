<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If we plan to build a quick chatbot, we need some pretrained models from OpenAI, Groq...etc.,
To use their models first we need to get the API keys, for now OpenAI paid version of API's keys only working. 
So I created with Groq API keys which is free for now.


### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dhamu2github/generativeai.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
